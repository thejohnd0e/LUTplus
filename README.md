# LUTplus - Image PostProcessing Tools

A powerful and user-friendly image post-processing tool built with Python and Gradio. LUTplus offers a wide range of image adjustment capabilities, including LUT (Look-Up Table) application, various noise effects, and basic image adjustments.

## Python Compatibility

**Important: Python Version Requirements**

LUTplus is compatible with:
- Python 3.9.x
- Python 3.10.x
- Python 3.11.x
- Python 3.12.x

**NOT Compatible with Python 3.13+**
Python 3.13 and newer versions are NOT supported because the required NumPy 1.x packages are not available for Python 3.13+. If you have Python 3.13 installed, please install an earlier version (recommended: Python 3.12.x) to use LUTplus.

**Note for Python 3.13+ Users:**
You don't need to uninstall your existing Python 3.13+ installation. Windows and most Linux distributions support multiple Python versions installed side-by-side. Simply install Python 3.12.9 (or any 3.12.x version) alongside your existing installation, and use it specifically for LUTplus. Your other applications can continue using Python 3.13+.

For best results, we recommend using Python 3.12.x for maximum compatibility and performance.

## Features

- **Main Effects:**
  - Brightness adjustment
  - Contrast control
  - Saturation adjustment
  - Color temperature
  - Gamma correction
  - Gaussian blur

- **Noise Effects:**
  - Color noise
  - Monochromatic noise
  - Gaussian noise
  - Digital grain

- **LUT Support:**
  - Support for .cube and .3dl LUT files
  - Adjustable LUT intensity
  - Professional-grade color grading

- **Batch Processing:**
  - Process multiple images at once
  - Preserve original file names
  - Support for various image formats

- **Preset System:**
  - Save custom settings
  - Load saved presets
  - Quick reset to defaults

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LUTplus.git
cd LUTplus
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
- Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- Linux/Mac:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the application using one of the following methods:

**Windows Users:**
- Use `run.bat` for local mode (accessible only on your computer)
- Use `run_network.bat` for network mode (accessible from other devices in your local network)

The difference:
- `run.bat`: Starts the application on localhost (127.0.0.1), making it accessible only from the computer it's running on
- `run_network.bat`: Starts the application in network mode, making it accessible from other devices in your local network via your computer's IP address

**Manual Start:**
```bash
python app.py           # For local mode
python app.py --network # For network mode
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:7860      # For local mode
http://[your-ip-address]:7860  # For network mode
```

3. Use the interface to:
- Upload an image
- Adjust various effects using sliders
- Apply LUT files
- Process images individually or in batch
- Save and load presets

## Supported Formats

- **Input Images:** JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF
- **LUT Files:** .cube, .3dl

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Gradio
- Pillow

See `requirements.txt` for complete list of dependencies.
